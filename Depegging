//Explanation:
//De-pegging (Price Manipulation):

//De-pegging refers to the manipulation of the price of an asset, causing it to deviate from its intended peg (e.g., a stablecoin losing its peg to a fiat currency).
//This contract uses a trusted price feed to ensure that all transactions are executed at the correct price, mitigating the risk of price manipulation.
//Price Feed:

//The contract interacts with a trusted price feed contract (IPriceFeed) to get the current price of the pegged token.
//The price feed should be a reliable source, such as a decentralized oracle, to prevent manipulation.
//Security Measures:

//Price Verification: Each deposit and withdrawal operation involves fetching the current price from the trusted price feed and verifying its validity.
//Balance Updates: The user's balance is updated before any transfers to prevent reentrancy attacks.
//Ether Conversion: Deposits and withdrawals are converted based on the current price, ensuring that users receive the correct amount of tokens or Ether.
//Steps:

//The deposit function allows users to deposit Ether, converting it to the pegged token units based on the current price from the price feed.
//The withdraw function allows users to withdraw their tokens, converting the token amount to Ether based on the current price from the price feed.

Hello everyone this is my Guide on how smart contracts work!

# SmartContractGuide

This repository contains a simple Solidity smart contract that acts as a guide to explain what a smart contract is and does. The smart contract includes comments on each line of code to provide a clear understanding of its functionality.

## What is a Smart Contract?

A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. It automatically enforces and executes the terms of the contract when certain conditions are met. Smart contracts run on blockchain platforms like Ethereum and offer transparency, security, and automation.

## Smart Contract Overview

The smart contract in this repository demonstrates a basic example of a smart contract that:

- Stores a value on the blockchain.
- Allows users to update the stored value.
- Emits an event whenever the stored value is updated.
- Provides a function to retrieve the stored value.

contract SmartContractGuide {
    // State variable to store an unsigned integer value. This value is stored permanently on the blockchain.
    uint public storedData;

    // Event declaration. Events allow logging of activity on the blockchain. Clients can listen to these events and act upon them.
    event DataStored(uint data);

    // Constructor function. This function is called only once when the contract is deployed.
    // It initializes the storedData variable with the value provided during deployment.
    constructor(uint initialData) {
        storedData = initialData; // Set the initial value of storedData to the provided initialData
    }

    // Function to update the storedData variable. It takes an unsigned integer as input.
    // This function allows users to change the value of storedData.
    function set(uint x) public {
        storedData = x; // Update the storedData variable with the new value x
        emit DataStored(x); // Emit the DataStored event, logging the new value
    }

    // Function to retrieve the current value of the storedData variable.
    // It is a view function, which means it does not alter the state of the blockchain.
    function get() public view returns (uint) {
        return storedData; // Return the current value of storedData
    }
}

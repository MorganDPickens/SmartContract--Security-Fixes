//Timestamp Dependence:
	//•	Relying on block timestamps for critical operations like determining randomness or time-based conditions can be manipulated by miners to some extent, as miners have control over the block timestamp within a certain range.
//	2.	Vulnerability:
//	•	The determineWinnerVulnerable function uses the block timestamp to decide the winner. Miners can manipulate the timestamp to influence the outcome.
//	3.	Mitigation:
//	•	Use more secure methods to generate randomness, such as combining multiple sources of entropy (e.g., block difficulty, blockhash) along with the block timestamp.
//	•	The determineWinnerSecure function mitigates timestamp manipulation by using a combination of block.difficulty, block.timestamp, and blockhash to generate a random seed.
//	4.	Steps:
	//•	The deposit and withdraw functions allow users to deposit and withdraw Ether from the contract.
//	•	The determineWinnerVulnerable function shows an example of how using block timestamps can be insecure.
//	•	The determineWinnerSecure function uses a more secure method to determine the winner, reducing the risk of manipulation.

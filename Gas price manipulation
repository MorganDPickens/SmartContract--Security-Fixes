//1.	Gas Price Manipulation:
//	•	Gas price manipulation can occur when users submit transactions with high gas prices to gain priority in the transaction ordering, potentially impacting contract logic that depends on transaction order or timing.
//	2.	Vulnerability:
//	•	In the GasPriceManipulationVulnerable contract, determining the winner based on the highest bid is directly linked to the timing of transaction processing. An attacker could use higher gas prices to manipulate the transaction ordering, ensuring their bid is processed last and highest.
	//3.	Mitigation:
	//•	Commit-Reveal Scheme: This approach prevents front-running and timing-based manipulation. In this scheme, users first commit a hash of their bid (which includes a secret nonce), and then later reveal the actual bid and nonce. The contract then verifies the hash matches the revealed values. This process decouples the bidding from the timing of transactions.
//	•	Access Control: The onlyOwner modifier restricts access to sensitive functions, ensuring that only the contract owner can perform certain actions.
//	4.	Steps:
	//•	The GasPriceManipulationSecure contract uses a commit-reveal scheme to secure the bidding process. Participants first commit to a bid hash and later reveal the actual bid with a nonce, ensuring that the bid cannot be manipulated after being committed.
//	•	The contract also has proper access control in place, ensuring that only authorized users can execute critical functions.
